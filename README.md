# SQUAD-2.0-Dataset

# Project Title: Build a dataset based on SQuAD 2.0 [1]

Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.

Current NLP model is given a paragraph, and a question about that paragraph, as input. The goal is to answer the question correctly. From a research perspective, this is an interesting task because it provides a measure for how well systems can ‘understand’ text. In fact, in the dev and test set, every SQuAD question has three answers provided – each answer from a different crowd worker. The answers don’t always completely agree, which is partly why ‘human performance’ on the SQuAD leaderboard is not 100%. 

In this project, you will become a Deep Learning NLP researcher!  The goal of this project is to sort out the ground truth answer that has no answer and classify it whether can be solve by implicit knowledge. So, you will explore the state-of-art knowledge graph technologies, such as Neo4j [2], and using provided tools to build knowledge graph
